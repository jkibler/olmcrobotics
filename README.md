OLMC Raiders Robotics Repository

This simple repository holds code utilized with VEX IQ robots.

The introductory code includes three variants:
  1. OLMC1-Slot1-Starterproject.iqblocks - Tests the first robot by moving, turning, strafing, and rotating arms. Slot 1
  2. 2-SimpleBlockMover.iqblocks - Moves and grabs a block; then, moves that block to a landing spot
  3. 3-FastSimpleBlockMover.iqblocks - Introduces the variability allowed within the device.  This changes the speed of the motors yet also shows the reduction in control.
